2. Get down to their level and say "Come" enthusiastically
3. Reward generously when they come
4. Never call them to come for something they perceive as negative

### 4. Down
Useful for calm, controlled behavior.

**Training Steps:**
1. Start with dog in sit position
2. Hold treat to their nose, then lower to ground
3. Say "Down" as they follow the treat
