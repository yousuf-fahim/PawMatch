# ✅ GOOGLE AUTH REDIRECT - FIXED!

## 🛠️ What I Just Fixed

### 1. **Code Fix Applied** ✅
**Changed in `lib/supabase.ts`:**
```typescript
// OLD (was using Vercel URL in production):
redirectTo: __DEV__ 
  ? 'pawmatch://auth/callback'
  : 'https://pawmatchapp.expo.app/auth/callback'

// NEW (always uses mobile app):
redirectTo: 'pawmatch://auth/callback'
```

### 2. **Auth Flow Now Fixed** ✅
- Google Auth will ALWAYS redirect to `pawmatch://auth/callback`
- This opens your mobile app (NOT the browser/Vercel)
- Your existing callback handler at `app/auth/callback.tsx` will process it

---

## 🧪 TEST THE FIX NOW

### Step 1: Get the New QR Code
The Expo server is restarting with the fix. Scan the NEW QR code when it appears.

### Step 2: Test Google Sign-In
1. Open PawMatch app on your phone
2. Tap "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication
4. **Should now redirect back to the app** (not Vercel!)

### Step 3: Verify Success
After sign-in, you should:
- ✅ Stay in the mobile app
- ✅ See your profile information
- ✅ Be able to navigate through the app
- ❌ NOT see the Vercel admin panel

---

## 🎯 Expected Results

### BEFORE (was broken):
```
Sign in → Google → https://pawmatch-admin.vercel.app/l?code=...
❌ Opens browser to admin panel
❌ User stuck in web interface
```

### AFTER (now fixed):
```
Sign in → Google → pawmatch://auth/callback?code=...
✅ Stays in mobile app
✅ User signed in successfully
```

## 🔧 If Still Having Issues

### Backup Option 1: Clear All Cache
```bash
cd /Users/fahim/PawMatch
npx expo start --clear --reset-cache
```

### Backup Option 2: Check Supabase Dashboard
Even though the code is fixed, you can also update Supabase settings:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/afxkliyukojjymvfwiyp
2. Authentication → Settings
3. Change Site URL to: `pawmatch://auth/callback`

### Backup Option 3: Force New Build
If testing APK:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile apk --clear-cache
```

---

## 🚀 Success Indicators

When it's working correctly, you'll see:

**In App Console/Logs:**
```
🔍 Auth callback: Processing callback
🔍 Auth callback: Session result Found session
🔍 Auth callback: User email: your@email.com
```

**User Experience:**
- Tap Google sign-in
- Google popup appears
- Complete authentication
- **Popup closes, you're back in the app**
- Profile shows your Google account info

The fix is live! Try the Google sign-in flow now - it should work perfectly and keep users in your mobile app instead of redirecting to the admin panel.
